            <h3>Hi, I’m Tina Yan, a front-end developer and designer.</h3>
            <h5>I’m a driven individual with great passion for coding and designing. I’m always working on improving
                myself.</h5>
            <h5> I started my career life as an Architect, in my 4 years of practicing, I really enjoyed providing design
                solutions to real life problems. It was also the era of Internet in China, our company decided to build
                online platforms to showcases projects. That’s when I gained interests in IT.</h5>
            <h5>I quit my job and went to study Design and Digital Media in the University of Edinburgh. During that
                time, I not only focused on designing, but also gained a detailed understanding of object oriented
                programming, web design and app development in both theoretical and applied contexts, which involved
                user interface design, user experience design and programming.</h5>
            <h5> After graduation, I started working as a multimedia designer. Then I co-founded Design + studio with my
                friends. We aim to provide services to clients who want to expand business internationally. The clients
                mainly come from Asia, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and so on. During the freelance work, I’m
                able to dive into and practice front-end development.</h5>
            <h5>I kept on learning throughout the entire journey. I taught myself from Freecodecamp and Udemy, learnt
                Front-End Web Development, tried to deploy projects with GitHub, and understood how to create SQL and
                MongoDB databases.</h5>
            <h5> I applied what I learned and realized how amazing it is to provide IT services to the people in need. So
                I decided to look for a professional job where I can fulfill my passion for coding and progress further.
            </h5>
            <h5>PS. I am also a makeup lover and sometime do vlogs on my YouTube channel.</h5>
